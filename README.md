# GraphPoem-DHSI

This repo contains computational analyses of and analytical-creative approaches to the 

MARGENTO community-based interplatform events #GraphPoem 

held at the Digital Humanities Summer Institute (DHSI) since 2017 (as well as other venues since 2001).

The events involve data-sharing, interactive coding, and livestreaming simultaneously across platforms such as JupyterHub (for coding), Twitter (botting, replaced with Facebook since 2025), and Facebook (posting/SM-interaction & livestreaming). 

The conglomerate of interplatform SM users/coders, AI (and other ML agents and algorithms), and (poetry) data, is seen as one hybrid-network evolving community--the #GraphPoem community.
